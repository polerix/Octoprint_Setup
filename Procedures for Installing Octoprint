The way I like to install Octoprint has a few steps.
1) download and install Octoprint using Raspberry Pi Imager
2) connect with Putty
3) raspi-config - expand Raspberry Pi filesystem setup, Raspberry Pi locale, and keyboard settings 
4) Install Pi desktop - sudo /home/pi/scripts/install-desktop
5) Setup the Wireless connection if needed using wpa_supplicant.conf
6) Add a custom message in etc/motd
7) add VNC server
8) add Chromium browser
9) log into vnc instance and set the home page of Chromium to http://localhost
10 setup Octoprint with the name of the printer it is using



use process found on https://octoprint.org/


sudo /home/pi/scripts/install-desktop

country=us
update_config=1
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant

network={
 scan_ssid=1
 ssid="MyNetworkSSID"
 psk="Pa55w0rd1234"
}



How to Install VNC on Raspberry Pi OS (64 bit) 
1. Open a terminal window either directly on the Raspberry Pi or by connecting remotely via SSH.

2.  Update the list of available software for the Raspberry Pi by typing:

sudo apt update

if it complains that there are upgradable packages not updated, run

sudo apt full-upgrade

3. Install tightvncserver by typing:

sudo apt install tightvncserver
4. Start the TightVNC server at 720p by typing:

tightvncserver -geometry 1280x720
5. Create a password to use the VNC session, set this to be the same as your pi login. There is no need to set a view only password. 

The Raspberry Pi has now started a VNC server session at raspberrypi.local:1 remember this address as it is needed later.

6. Download and install the RealVNC viewer for your operating system from RealVNC.com.
