The way I like to install Octoprint has a few steps.
1) download and install Octoprint using Raspberry Pi Imager
2) connect with Putty
3) raspi-config - expand Raspberry Pi filesystem setup, Raspberry Pi locale, and keyboard settings 
4) Install Pi desktop - sudo /home/pi/scripts/install-desktop
5) Setup the Wireless connection if needed using wpa_supplicant.conf
6) Add a custom message in etc/motd
7) add VNC server
8) add Chromium browser
9) log into vnc instance and set the home page of Chromium to http://localhost
10 setup Octoprint with the name of the printer it is using
