Two ways of doing this - with the sd card in the computer BEFORE you start up the Raspberry Pi
and directly the WPA Supplicant.conf file

In either case, the content of the file is the same
Open Octopi-wpa-supplicant.txt and copy the file directly to the sd card
or use nano and copy the content to WPA supplicant.conf
