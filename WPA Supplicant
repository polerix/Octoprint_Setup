Two ways of doing this - with the sd card in the computer BEFORE you start up the Raspberry Pi
and directly the wpa_supplicant.conf file

https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2017/04/manually-setting-up-pi-wifi-using-wpa_supplicant-conf/

In either case, the content of the file is the same

Download octopi-wpa-supplicant.txt from this github

The SD card will mount as a drive/directory on your computer called "boot". 
Open the drive using Finder (Mac) or Explorer (Windows).
copy the file directly to the sd card.

on startup the Raspberry Pi will copy the contents to the wpa_supplicant.conf

The second way, is to type the command to open the file, and paste the information from the file into wpa_supplicant.conf

in terminal enter

sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

then CTLR-o to write out, and CTRL-x to exit nano

reboot the raspberry pi and you should be on wifi

if ever you need to edit the file, here is what you are looking for

## WPA/WPA2 secured
network={
  ssid="NAMEOFYOURWIRELESSNETWORK"
  psk="PASSWORDOFYOURWIRELESSNETWORK"
}

take any # that are commenting out these lines, make sure the SSID has both quotes on it, as well as the password.
